# Expression-Calculator
A console application meant to calculate a mathematical expression typed by the user. I have created this in order to familiarize myself with the C# programming language. The algorithms used are likely not the fastest they can be, and floating point numbers are not very precise. There are two main components to it: creating the postfix form out of the string introduced by the user and evaluating the postifx form itself. I want to create a version of this application which uses a GUI instead of the console in the near future.
